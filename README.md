# üöÄ AeroSwift Drone Logistics Management System

### **Efficient ‚Ä¢ Automated ‚Ä¢ Compliant**

AeroSwift is a **drone-based logistics management system** designed to automate and monitor the full lifecycle of drone deliveries ‚Äî from order placement to pilot assignment, compliance validation, and flight logging.  

Developed as part of a **Database Management Systems (DBMS)** project, this system demonstrates how **relational databases**, **stored procedures**, and **Streamlit dashboards** can model real-world logistics automation.

## üß© **Project Overview**

AeroSwift Logistics simulates a company that uses **autonomous drones** and **certified pilots** to transport lightweight packages across delivery zones in Indian cities.  
The system handles:

- Customer and order management  
- Drone and pilot allocation  
- Flight route validation  
- Airspace compliance checks  
- Real-time delivery tracking and reporting  

All workflows are **automatically triggered** via MySQL **stored procedures** and **triggers**, simulating an intelligent logistics control center.
